# Write Docs

If you're writing code, you should also update any related docs. However, you might want to write docs only, such as:

- General explainers
- Tutorials
- Courses
- Code explanations
- How BigchainDB relates to other blockchain things
- News from recent events

You can certainly do that!

- The docs for BigchainDB Server live under ``corechaindb/docs/`` in the ``corechaindb/corechaindb`` repo.
- There are docs for the Python driver under ``corechaindb-driver/docs/`` in the ``corechaindb/corechaindb-driver`` repo.
- There are docs for the JavaScript driver under ``corechaindb/js-corechaindb-driver`` in the ``corechaindb/js-corechaindb-driver`` repo.
- The source code for the BigchainDB website is in a private repo, but we can give you access if you ask.

The [BigchainDB Transactions Specs](https://github.com/corechaindb/BEPs/tree/master/tx-specs/) (one for each spec version) are in the ``corechaindb/BEPs`` repo.

You can write the docs using Markdown (MD) or RestructuredText (RST). Sphinx can understand both. RST is more powerful.

ReadTheDocs will automatically rebuild the docs whenever a commit happens on the ``master`` branch, or on one of the other branches that it is monitoring.
