# corechaindb Networks

A **corechaindb network** is a set of connected **corechaindb nodes**, managed by a **corechaindb consortium** (i.e. an organization). Those terms are defined in the [corechaindb Terminology page](https://docs.corechaindb.com/en/latest/terminology.html).

## Consortium Structure & Governance

The consortium might be a company, a foundation, a cooperative, or [some other form of organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_structure).
It must make many decisions, e.g. How will new members be added? Who can read the stored data? What kind of data will be stored?
A governance process is required to make those decisions, and therefore one of the first steps for any new consortium is to specify its governance process (if one doesn't already exist).
This documentation doesn't explain how to create a consortium, nor does it outline the possible governance processes.

It's worth noting that the decentralization of a corechaindb network depends,
to some extent, on the decentralization of the associated consortium. See the pages about [decentralization](https://docs.corechaindb.com/en/latest/decentralized.html) and [node diversity](https://docs.corechaindb.com/en/latest/diversity.html).

## DNS Records and SSL Certificates

We now describe how *we* set up the external (public-facing) DNS records for a corechaindb network. Your consortium may opt to do it differently.
There were several goals:

* Allow external users/clients to connect directly to any corechaindb node in the network (over the internet), if they want.
* Each corechaindb node operator should get an SSL certificate for their corechaindb node, so that their corechaindb node can serve the [corechaindb HTTP API](../api/http-client-server-api) via HTTPS. (The same certificate might also be used to serve the [WebSocket API](../api/websocket-event-stream-api).)
* There should be no sharing of SSL certificates among corechaindb node operators.
* Optional: Allow clients to connect to a "random" corechaindb node in the network at one particular domain (or subdomain).

### Node Operator Responsibilities

1. Register a domain (or use one that you already have) for your corechaindb node. You can use a subdomain if you like. For example, you might opt to use `abc-org73.net`, `api.dynabob8.io` or `figmentdb3.ninja`.
2. Get an SSL certificate for your domain or subdomain, and properly install it in your node (e.g. in your NGINX instance).
3. Create a DNS A Record mapping your domain or subdomain to the public IP address of your node (i.e. the one that serves the corechaindb HTTP API).

### Consortium Responsibilities

Optional: The consortium managing the corechaindb network could register a domain name and set up CNAME records mapping that domain name (or one of its subdomains) to each of the nodes in the network. For example, if the consortium registered `bdbnetwork.io`, they could set up CNAME records like the following:

* CNAME record mapping `api.bdbnetwork.io` to `abc-org73.net`
* CNAME record mapping `api.bdbnetwork.io` to `api.dynabob8.io`
* CNAME record mapping `api.bdbnetwork.io` to `figmentdb3.ninja`
