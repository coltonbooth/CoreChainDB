# Release Notes

You can find a list of all BigchainDB Server releases and release notes on GitHub at:

[https://github.com/corechaindb/corechaindb/releases](https://github.com/corechaindb/corechaindb/releases)

The [CHANGELOG.md file](https://github.com/corechaindb/corechaindb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) contains much the same information, but it also has notes about what to expect in the _next_ release.

We also have [a roadmap document in ROADMAP.md](https://github.com/corechaindb/org/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).
